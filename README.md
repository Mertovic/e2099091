I created Qr Code Generator. Firstly, Qr code is composed and then we choose a file (.png) and we can read it. 

I used html to generate it and by using Azure, we can reach http://e2099091.azurewebsites.net/

First, we can create what we want it as a text and then we choose color(Black,White,Red,Green,Blue) and then we choose background color the same color. 

PS: It generate only black and white color. Other colors cannot work because API do not support them.
